# Basic Keylogger Program

This project is a simple keylogger built using Python's `pynput` library. It records keystrokes and saves them to a log file for educational and ethical use only.

## Features

- Logs all printable characters and special keys (e.g., `Enter`, `Backspace`).
- Saves keystrokes to a file named `keylog.txt`.
- Exits gracefully when the `Esc` key is pressed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install the required library:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
Usage
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python keylogger.py
The program will record all keystrokes and save them to a file named keylog.txt in the current directory.
Press the Esc key to stop the keylogger.
Example Output
If you type "Hello World!" followed by pressing Enter, the keylog.txt file will look like this:

Copy code
Hello World! [Key.enter]
